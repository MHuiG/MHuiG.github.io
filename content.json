恒星漫天的时代 the age of the starts. 我们的太阳只是银河系两千亿颗恒星中的一颗 Our sun is just one of 200 billion starts in our qalaxy. 我们的星系也只是可观测的宇宙范围内的 Our qalaxy is one of 100 bllion 一百亿个星系中的一个 in the observable universe. 数不尽的星球上有数不胜数的岛屿 And countless islands of countless stars. 当我们注意太空的时候 When we look out into space, 我们也是在寻找自己的起源 we are looking into our own origins. 我们的故事就是宇宙的故事 Our story is the story of the universe. 因为我们是恒星真正的孩子 Beacuse we are truly children of the starts. 注入进我们的身体的 and written into every atom 每一个原子和分子 and every molecule of our bodies 就是宇宙从大爆炸 is the entire history of the universe 到现在全部的历史 from the Big Bang to the present day. 对我们来说 像婚戒黄金一样的珍宝 It’s quite a thought that something as 实际上也可以在一颗遥远的 数百万光年 precious to us as the gold in a wedding ring was 甚至数十亿光年远的恒星上产生actually forged in the death of a distant star. 从宇宙起源到最后一个黑洞消失的这个过程中 as measured from its beainning to the evappration of the last black hole. 生命 正如我们所知life as we konw it, is only possible 只有百分之千亿分之for one thousandth of a billion billion billionth 千亿分之千分之一的可能性billion billion billionth billion billion billionth of a percent. 所以对于我来说 And that’s why for me 宇宙中最迷人的奇迹不是恒星 the most astonishing wonder of the universe isn’t a star 不是行星 也不是星系 or a planet or a galaxy 甚至根本不是一个物质 It isn’t a thing at all 而是时间里的一瞬间 It’s an instant in time 那个瞬间 就是现在 And that time is now. 当我们仰望天空 You see, when we look up into the sky, 望向遥远的恒星和星系时 at distant starts and galaxies, 我们其实是在仰望过去 then we’re looking back in time 因为光从那些遥远天体到达地球需要时间 because the light takes time to journey from them to us. 而光从那个红点处传播到我们这里 And the light from that red dot has been travelling to us 差不多经历了整个宇宙史 for almost the entire history of the universe. 我们看到的是一百三十亿年前 You see, what we’re looking at here is an event that happened 发生的事件 13 billion years ago. 我们看到的是宇宙初期的一颗恒星 What we’re looking at here is the explosive death 爆炸灭亡的景象 of one of the first starts in the universe. 一日为二十四个小时 A day on Earth is the 24 hours 即地球绕轴自转一周 it takes our planet to rotate once on its axis. 一月为二十九天半 Our months are based on the 29-and-a-half days 即月亮在夜空完成盈亏圆缺 it takes the moon to wax and wane in the night sky. 一年为三百六十五天又四分之一天 And a year is the 365-and-a-quarter days 即地球绕太阳公转一周 it takes us to orbit once around the sun. 人类的生命便消逝在这些熟悉的时间量程之内 These familiar timescales mark the passing of our lives. 这是宇宙无法避免的真相 It’s an inescapable fact of the universe, 也被写入了物理学基本定律 written into the fundamental laws of physics, 整个宇宙将消亡 The entire cosmos will die, 银河系中的两千亿恒星将全部消亡 Every single one of the 200 billion starts in our galaxy will go out. 如同太阳末日 便是地球末日 And just as the death of the sun means the end of life on our planet, 每一颗恒星的灭亡 so the death of every star 都可能预示着宇宙中其他某种生命的灭亡 will extinguish any possibility of life in the universe. 永恒的变化是人类生命中最基本的部分 Permanent change is a fundamental part of what it means to be human. 随着时间流逝 我们都会变老We all age as the years pass by. 人们出生 成长 死亡People are born, they live, they die. 我想这只是生命中悲悲喜喜的一部分I suppose it’s part of the joy and tragedy of our lives. 但纵观宇宙But out there in the universe, 那些宏伟的如史诗般的循环好像永恒不变those grand and epic cycles appear eternal and unchanging. 然而这只是错觉But that’s an illlusion. 宇宙长河就如同我们的生命一样You see, in the life of the universe, just in our lives, 一切都在不可逆转地变化everything is irreversibly changing. 我们从没见过浪花离开过湖面We never see waves travelling across lakes.聚集在一起 组成巨大的冰块重回冰川coming together and bouncing chunks of ice back onto glaciers. 我们被迫前往将来We are compelled to travel into the future. 那是因为And that’s because 时间箭头规定 随着时间流逝the arrow of time dictates that as each moment passes, 万物也在发生变化things change. 变化一旦发生 就无法更改And once these changes have happend, they are never undone. 这些循环看似永恒不变These cycles seem eternal and unchanging, 但随着时间之书徐徐展开but as the story of time unfolds, 一条真理跃然眼前afundamental truth is revealed. 没有什么能够永恒Nothing lates forever.","categories":[{"name":"Time","slug":"time","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/categories/time/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Time","slug":"time","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/tags/time/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"yuque/Hello World","date":"2020-04-19T06:24:29.000Z","updated":"2020-04-27T03:25:29.387Z","comments":true,"path":"posts/4a17b156.html","link":"","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/posts/4a17b156.html","excerpt":"你好，世界！","text":"你好，世界！ 全新的主题，熟悉的代码，怎能不再次心动？ 这是MHuiG的又一个博客！ 原博客数据不再迁移此处，将其作为该博客的子站我的 NoteBook: https://mhuig.github.io/NoteBook/","categories":[{"name":"Hello","slug":"hello","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/categories/hello/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Hello","slug":"hello","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/tags/hello/"}]}],"categories":[{"name":"Time","slug":"time","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/categories/time/"},{"name":"Hello","slug":"hello","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/categories/hello/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Time","slug":"time","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/tags/time/"},{"name":"Hello","slug":"hello","permalink":"https://mhuig.github.io/tags/hello/"}]}
